<h1>What Is Cardio?</h1>

<p>
Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone. This is the zone where you burn the most fat and calories.
Some of the most common examples of cardio include walking, cycling, and swimming. However, even household chores like vacuuming and mopping can qualify as cardio exercise.
Part of what sets cardio apart from other types of exercise—such as strength training—is that it relies on your body's ability to use oxygen during the workout session. A person's cardio ability or capacity can vary based on a number of factors.
Research published by the American Heart Association reports that genetics have a 20% to 40% influence over what you can do cardio-wise.

1 Also, females tend to have a 25% lower cardio capacity than males and, for both sexes, this capacity tends to decline with age.
This is not to say that your genes, sex, or age will prevent you from improving your cardiovascular health. But it does help to know that there are many factors that can influence how (and how well) your body responds to cardio exercise.
There are very few activities you can do for a short period of time that have all of the physical and mental health benefits that cardio exercise offers. Some of the known benefits of cardio include:

<br>
<li> Enhances sleep quality, especially if the exercise is moderate to vigorous in intensity</li>
<br>
<li> Expands lung capacity, or the amount of air that your lungs can hold</li>
</ul>
